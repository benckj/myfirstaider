# API Data Analysis Project

This project accesses an API at https://api.example.com (replace with the actual API URL from the website), downloads the data, and creates a graph representation of the data where applicable.

## Data Fields

Note: The following descriptions are placeholders. You should replace these with actual descriptions based on the data you receive from the API.

- `id`: Unique identifier for each data point
- `x`: X-coordinate or independent variable
- `y`: Y-coordinate or dependent variable
- `category`: Categorical variable representing different groups or types
- `timestamp`: Time when the data point was recorded

Please refer to the `api_data_analysis.ipynb` Jupyter notebook for the implementation details and data visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: requests, pandas, matplotlib

To install the required libraries, run:

```
pip install requests pandas matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Open the `api_data_analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells in order to fetch data from the API and visualize it.

Note: Make sure you have an active internet connection to access the API.
